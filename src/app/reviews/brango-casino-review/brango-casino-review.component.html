                            <p>Brango Casino is not a new player in the casino space and has been around since 2017, giving it more than five years of experience. The site seems to bring a lot of good points to the table, but before we can go ahead and give it our recommendation, we
                            need to put it through our full and comprehensive review process. We sent our team of casino experts with a mission to see if Brango Casino is good enough to earn our recommendation. Let&rsquo;s see what they found during the review.</p>
                            <h2>Casinos Like Brango Casino</h2>
                            <app-main-table></app-main-table>
                            <h2>Brango Casino Welcome Bonus and Promotions</h2>
                            <p>Let&rsquo;s kick things off with a visit to the bonuses and promotions on offer at Brango Casino. When creating an account at Brango Casino, you will be treated to a $30 No Deposit Bonus. Simply put in the code BRANGO30, and it will be credited to your
                            account. To get the No Deposit Bonus, you need to be from the United States, Canada, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, or Sweden.</p>
                            <p>Following the No Deposit Bonus, players can then claim the proper Welcome Bonus, worth up to $2000. This is split up over the player&rsquo;s first five deposits, with a 100% Bonus up to $400 for each of those deposits. There is a 15x wagering requirement
                            on the bonus, which is significantly lower than many other competitors.</p>
                            <p>For existing players, there are several other bonuses on offer, with various reload, and free spin offers. You certainly won&rsquo;t feel let down by the bonus offerings at Brango Casino.</p>
                            <h2>Brango Customer Support</h2>
                            <p>When we review a casino site, we expect to see customer support that is available 24-hours a day. Not only do we expect this, but players do as well. No one wants to have their gambling interrupted by technical issues. Thankfully, Brango Casino fully
                            understands this and offers 24/7 support, as well as an FAQ page. If you need to get in touch with support, you can do so by using Live Chat or email. Live Chat will get you a much faster response, so if your request is urgent, use that over email. We
                            found the support staff to be very friendly and professional in assisting with queries.</p>
                            <h2>Banking Options at Brango Casino</h2>
                            <p>When it comes to choosing a new casino site, players often overlook the banking options. This is a crucial mistake, as players need to be able to safely deposit and withdraw money from their account. We were very impressed to see all the banking options
                            available at Brango Casino. They include debit and credit cards, eWallets, and Cryptocurrencies. When it comes to deposits, there is a good selection on offer. Below is a breakdown of all the deposit options on offer.</p>

                            <p>The most exciting part of any casino review for us is to look at the casino games. Brango Casino is another casino site that uses RealTime Gaming. This means players will have access to just over 200 different casino games available to them. There is
                            a wide range of different slots on offer, around 150, each offering its own unique theme.</p>
                            <p>Besides the slot selection, there are plenty of table games and other player favourites. There are multiple popular versions of Blackjack, Baccarat, Craps, Roulette, Poker, and more. All in all, we are happy with the game selection, and we think players
                            will be as well.</p>
                            <h2>Brango Mobile Casino</h2>
                            <p>These days, players expect to be able to play their favourite casino games whenever, and wherever they want to. This means that casinos need to offer a compelling mobile gambling experience. Brango Casino understands this and offers its players a great
                            mobile experience. There is no need to download any casino app. Players can access their casino accounts directly from their smartphone or tablet&rsquo;s web browser. This means that no matter what mobile device you have, whether that is Android, Apple,
