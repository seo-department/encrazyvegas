                            <p>Casino Extreme has been around since the year 2000, giving it over 20 years of experience running online casinos. For a casino site to still be around after two decades, the casino must be doing something right! However, just because a casino has been
                            around for a while, doesn&rsquo;t mean it can get an automatic recommendation from our team. So, we sent our team on a mission to see if this 20+-year-old casino meets our standards or if the casino is past its time. Let&rsquo;s jump into their findings
                            and see what they thought of Casino Extreme.</p>
                            <h2>Casinos Like Casino Extreme</h2>
                            <app-main-table></app-main-table>
                            <h2>Casino Extreme Bonuses and Promotions</h2>
                            <p>Let&rsquo;s start by looking at the bonuses and promotions on offer for new and existing players at Casino Extreme. New players signing up will first be treated to a $50 No Deposit Bonus. This is great news for players, as No Deposit bonuses are not that
                            common anymore.</p>
                            <p>Once you have claimed your No Deposit Bonus at Casino Extreme, it is time to move on to the main Welcome Bonus package. New players will be able to claim a $3000 Welcome bonus over their first six deposits. On each of these six deposits, players will
                            be given a 100% Bonus of up to $500. There is a 15x Wagering Requirement on the Welcome Bonus, which is much lower than many competitor sites.</p>
                            <p>There is also a 200% Crypto Bonus on your first deposit with cryptocurrency. For existing players, there are cashback bonuses and a few others. All in all, we think players will be very happy with the bonuses on offer at Casino Extreme.</p>
                            <h2>Casino Extreme Customer Support</h2>
                            <p>Next on our list of things we need to check off before giving it our recommendation is customer support. We all know how important it is to get good customer support when you need it, so we were very happy to see that Casino Extreme offers excellent 24/7
                            support. Players can contact the friendly support staff via Live Chat, toll-free telephone, and email. The quickest way to get assistance is via live chat, so make sure to use Live Chat if your request is urgent.</p>
                            <h2>Banking Methods at Casino Extreme</h2>
                            <p>Looking into banking methods is not the most exciting part of choosing a new casino and is often overlooked. However, it is one of the most important considerations for players. Casino Extreme understands the importance of a good selection of deposit
                            and withdrawal options and has plenty to offer. When it comes to deposits, players can use the following to fund their account.</p>
