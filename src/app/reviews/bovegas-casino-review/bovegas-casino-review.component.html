                        <p><strong><img src="https://cdn.cosmicjs.com/992484a0-2c17-11ec-a256-9f386f540f3a-146x70-bovegas-casino.png" style="width: 146px;" class="right-image" alt="BoVegas Casino Reviews">BoVegas Online Casino</strong> is an American-friendly casino site
                            that has been open since 2017. With over three years of operation, the casino has developed a good reputation with players. As with so many casinos operating in the USA, BoVegas uses RealTime Gaming as its software provider. This means there is a good
                            selection of games on offer, but how does everything else stack up against the competition? We decided to put <em>BoVegas casino</em> through our strict review process to see if we can recommend it to our readers. Read through our full review below!</p>
                            <h2>Casinos Similar to BoVegas</h2>

                            <h2>BoVegas Welcome Bonuses and Promotions</h2>
                            <p>One of the first things people look at when choosing a new casino site is the bonuses and promotional offers. So, we took a look at the welcome bonus, as well as other bonus offers to see if they&rsquo;re any good. We&rsquo;re happy to report that BoVegas
                            does really well in this area. There are two welcome bonus offers on offer. These are exclusive for slot games and come with no Max Cashout limit. The first part of the welcome bonus is a 250% Slot bonus up to $2500, using the code BOVEGAS250. After using
                            this code, then players can claim a 300% Bonus up to $3000, with the code BOVEGAS300.</p>
                            <p>There are then also other bonus offers for existing players, like Weekend deposit bonuses, as well as other monthly bonuses. All bonuses come with a 50x wagering requirement, which is slightly higher than some of the competition out there.</p>
                            <h2>BoVegas Casino Banking Options</h2>
                            <p>When it comes to choosing a casino site, the banking options are not the most exciting criteria to look at. But, as any experienced gambler knows, they are vitally important. Without proper ways to deposit money, you cannot fund your account, and we all
                            know you need a way to withdraw winnings when you get lucky.</p>
                            <p>BoVegas has a decent selection of banking options. When depositing money, players can use Visa, Mastercard, Bitcoin, and Secure Payment Voucher. All methods have a minimum deposit amount of $25. Visa and Mastercard have maximum deposit limits of $1000,
                            while Bitcoin allows for an unlimited deposit amount.</p>
                            <p>As for withdrawing winnings, there is a slightly smaller selection, but it should still be perfectly fine for most players. Players can use Visa, Mastercard, and bank transfers. All of them have a $100 minimum withdrawal amount and a maximum withdrawal
                            amount of $2000. Only one withdrawal can be requested per week, and they should take between 3-7 business days to pay out the winnings.</p>
                            <h2>Customer Support at BoVegas</h2>
                            <p>Customer support is a very important area we look at carefully when reviewing a casino. We&rsquo;re happy to report that BoVegas ticks all the right boxes in the customer support area. The support team is available 24-hours a day, and the team can be
                            reached via live chat, email, or several toll-free telephone numbers. We also found the support staff very friendly, professional, and helpful.</p>
                            <h2>BoVegas Game Selection</h2>
                            <p>Now we&rsquo;re on to the exciting stuff, the casino games. This is the part that people spend most of their time examining before choosing their next casino. BoVegas is a RealTime Gaming Casino, meaning the game selection is good, but nothing special.
                            So many casinos in the US market use RTG, so the game list will be very familiar.</p>
                            <p>This is not a negative though, RealTime Gaming makes some fantastic games, including slots and table games like Roulette, Blackjack, Baccarat, Craps, Video Poker, and more. There are around 200 games on offer. One of the most exciting recent developments
                            with RealTime Gaming is their addition of Live Dealer games, which are also available at BoVegas.</p>
                            <h2>BoVegas Mobile Gaming</h2>
                            <p>When it comes to gambling on mobile, BoVegas has you covered. There is no need to download any apps, simply visit the site from your phone&rsquo;s web browser and log in with your normal details. All the games are fully optimized to work on mobile devices,
                            with smaller screens and touch controls. Mobile users will have access to the full library of games, and users can enjoy them wherever they are.</p>
                            <h2>Player Safety and Security at BoVegas</h2>
                            <p>One of the most important considerations for us before we can recommend it is player safety and security. Our team looked into it, and we&rsquo;re happy to report that BoVegas is fully licenced and regulated by a reputable third-party organization. The
                            games are also regularly tested for fairness to ensure they&rsquo;re not rigged. Finally, all player data is fully encrypted and protected to ensure no one gets unauthorized access to personal data.</p>
                            <h2>BoVegas Casino Review Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>So, now that we have come to the end of our review, one question remains. Can we recommend BoVegas casino to our readers? Our team had nothing but good things to say about BoVegas. We really enjoyed our time at the casino. The welcome bonuses and promotional
                            offers are great; there is 24/7 customer support, a good selection of games, and good banking options. If you&rsquo;re looking for a new casino with RealTime Gaming games, BoVegas is a great choice. We give it 4 out of 5.</p>
