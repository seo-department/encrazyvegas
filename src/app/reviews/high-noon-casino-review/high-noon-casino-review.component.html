                        <p>High Noon is an online casino site, bringing a touch of the Old West to online gamblers. The Old Western theme is unique. The site first opened up in 2010 and now has over ten years of experience offering casino games to online players. Our team decided
                            to spend some time with High Noon Casino to see how good the casino is and if we can recommend it to our readers. Let&rsquo;s see what our experts thought of High Noon after spending some time with the casino.</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Both of these bonus codes come with a 50x Wagering Requirement and come with a $75 free chip when using Bitcoin to make their deposit. The amazing bonuses don&rsquo;t stop there, though; existing players will be treated to bonus offers every day of the
                            week. These bonuses include various reload bonuses, as well as some free spins. Be sure to check out all of the daily promotional bonuses. We&rsquo;re sure our readers will be very pleased with the bonus offers at High Noon Casino!</p>
