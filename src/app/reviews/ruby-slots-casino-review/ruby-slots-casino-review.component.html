                        <p><img src="https://cdn.cosmicjs.com/b689c2a0-2cbf-11ec-a256-9f386f540f3a-146x70-ruby-slots-casino.png" style="width: 146px;" class="right-image" alt="Ruby Slots Casino Reviews">
                            <p>Ruby Slots Casino is an exciting new casino that accepts US players.
                            The online casino has been operating since 2004, not that you&rsquo;d be able to tell. They&rsquo;ve upgraded in a big way to make their online casino more accessible to players. Right off the bat, everything is easy to find, including the sign-up button.
                            With that in mind, we were quick to start reviewing the rest of Ruby Slots Casino.</p>
                            <h2>Casinos Similar to Ruby Slots</h2>

                           <app-main-table></app-main-table>
                            <h2>Ruby Slots Bonuses and Promotions</h2>
                            <p>First and foremost, the welcome bonus offer at Ruby Slots is pretty great. New players can claim up to $2500 with two bonus codes. The first is a slot match bonus of 250% to the value of $1500 with the code RUBY250. Second is the table games bonus of
                            100% up to $1000 with the code: RUBY100. Further promotions will either be announced or take place monthly. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the regular bonuses available:</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>RUBYRAIN Bonus Code</strong> &ndash; 100% Bonus on slots and table games. With 10x bonus + deposit amount Max Cashout on 30x playthrough on slots and 60x playthrough on table games.</li>
                            <li><strong>GEMSTONE</strong><strong>&nbsp;Bonus Code</strong> &ndash; 160% Bonus on blackjack and table games. With 10x bonus + deposit amount Max Cashout on 30x playthrough on slots and 60x playthrough on table games.</li>
                            <li><strong>RUBYGLASS Bonus Code</strong> &ndash; 200% Bonus on slots and keno. No Max Cashout, no playthrough, no withdrawal requirements.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Additionally, all players can earn comp points from the casino for playing their predetermined games. This includes the no deposit bonus offers and any other offers. However, all promotions at this casino have a minimum deposit requirement of $30 to claim
                            bonus codes. This is clearly stated in the promotional terms and conditions. So, double-check before claiming any bonus codes.</p>
                            <h2>Player Support</h2>
                            <p>Support is readily available for Ruby Slots USA players across the casino. But, you will need to be logged in to message their team on Live Chat. Also, it offers two email addresses for players, one for deposits and the other for general help.</p>
                            <h2>Banking Options</h2>
                            <p>At Ruby Slots, players have a few options to make a deposit and a withdrawal. USA players will be able to use Bitcoin for deposits and withdrawals. However, players will have to sign a credit card agreement form if they want to use Visa and Mastercard
                            to make a deposit. Moreover, the two available withdrawal options are subject to requirements. Here&rsquo;s a full breakdown:</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Visa &amp; Mastercard</strong> &ndash; no deposit limits, as long as the form is provided. Double charges and other reversals will be investigated for refunds.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bitcoin</strong> &ndash; there are no limits on deposits and no limits on withdrawals, but the current value will be used.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bank Wire&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; to withdraw, players must request $200 or more. Other terms may also apply, so check the legal conditions first.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bank Check&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; this method is subject to bank processing fees and any overnight fees. More so, the minimum amount is $300 in consideration of the charges. Checks are sent by courier to home addresses within 3-8 days.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>Game Selection</h2>
                            <p>At this casino, USA players have access to the full RealTime Gaming library. This includes all slot machines and table games they have created. New releases are also regularly added. However, the instant play version is of lower quality, so players will
                            have to download the desktop app. At least the casino has been proven fair by a regulator.</p>
                            <h2>Ruby Slots Mobile Casino</h2>
                            <p>From what we can tell, there&rsquo;s no mobile Ruby Slots app. In addition, the site is barely optimized for mobile. There&rsquo;s not a lot to say here, and we&rsquo;re pretty disappointed. Instant play can be used, and the games are at least mobile-friendly.</p>
                            <h2>Safety and Security</h2>
                            <p>One good thing we noticed is that the casino uses top-of-the-line encryption technology. In this aspect, they&rsquo;ve opted for 256-bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. All gameplay and banking will be protected. So, personal information will be
                            secure.</p>
                            <h2>Ruby Slots Casino Review Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>Overall, Ruby Slots is a great desktop casino. Even though the instant play option is not the greatest, it&rsquo;s good enough for casual gaming. While we were disappointed by mobile, they make up for it by going above and beyond on security. Their support
                            team is available 24/7, and the banking options are secured enough. Moreover, the bonuses were pretty generous, though we highly recommend reading through all of the casino rules multiple times to avoid losing your winnings.</p>
                            <p>So, for these reasons, we&rsquo;ve decided to award Ruby Slots Casino a three-star rating out of a possible five-star rating.</p>
