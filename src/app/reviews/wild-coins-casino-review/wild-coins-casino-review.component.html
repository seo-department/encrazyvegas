                        <h1>WildCoins Review: Is WildCoins Casino Worthy of Your Investments?</h1>

                        <p>All casinos fall under different categories: slot casinos, casinos with live games or without them, sports betting casinos, etc. About a decade ago, one category of online gambling platforms started to become increasingly popular, and these were the so-called
                            crypto casinos. They, in turn, can be divided into two main groups&mdash;mixed casinos and casinos that work only with crypto players. WildCoins is a company that doesn&rsquo;t let players deposit or withdraw money in fiat currencies
                            but allows them to choose between a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Does that work as well as it&rsquo;s supposed to? Find the answer in this WildCoins review.</p>
                            <h2>Is WildCoins licensed?</h2>
                            <p>The license is the first thing that players should check. Like many new casinos, Wildcoins has an Antillephone gambling license issued to the Hollycorn company that owns and operates this online gambling platform.</p>
                            <h2>What about the currencies?</h2>
                            <p>So, you can&rsquo;t choose the fiat currency when creating an account on Wildcoins&mdash;it&rsquo;s not a mixed casino, only cryptocurrencies are accepted. There are 6 of them, but the good news is these are the most widely used options:</p>
                            <p>Bitcoin&mdash;you can deposit 0.0001 Bitcoin and more, and withdraw up to 0.074 Bitcoin</p>
                            <p>Bitcoin Cash&mdash;you can deposit 0.001 Bitcoin Cash and more, and withdraw up to 8 BCH</p>
                            <p>Ethereum&mdash;you can deposit 0.01 Ethereum and more, and withdraw up to 0.9 ETH</p>
                            <p>Litecoin&mdash;you can deposit 0.01 Litecoin and more, and withdraw up to 23 LTC</p>
                            <p>Dogecoin&mdash;you can deposit 1 Dogecoin and more, and withdraw up to 20,815 DOGE</p>
                            <p>Tether&mdash;you can deposit 0.0001 USDT and more, and withdraw up to 3,000 USDT</p>
                            <p>The best thing about using cryptocurrencies is that the transactions aren&rsquo;t trackable, and well, members don&rsquo;t have to provide that many details to the company to process a payment. However, there&rsquo;s one important thing to consider&mdash;though
                            withdrawals can be instant and there are no fees, non-verified users may have to wait until their crypto payments are processed by the company.</p>
                            <h2>The game selection at WildCoins</h2>
                            <p>Let&rsquo;s say you have some crypto and want to spend it at WildCoins. Which games will you be able to play? There are thousands of them, actually. In particular, users who join the community can choose between:</p>
