                            is a full breakdown of every method available:</p>
                            <h3>Deposit Methods</h3>
                            <ul>
                            <li>Visa and Mastercard</li>
                            <li>Neteller (not available in USA)</li>
                            <li>Bitcoin</li>
                            </ul>

                            </ul>
                            <p>With regards to withdrawals, it is important to note that players are limited to a maximum payout of US$2000. It is possible to raise this limit if you become a VIP player. In addition, upon requesting a withdrawal, players will be required to verify
                            their personal details, such as email, physical address, and phone numbers.</p>
                            <p>One area of concern is that there is no estimated timeframe given for payouts. It is stated that your payout time is largely dependent on the banking method used, with Bitcoin and e-wallets being much faster than other options.</p>

                            <p>There is no phone option, but that isn&rsquo;t too much of a big deal given that email and live chat are more likely to get answers to your queries faster.</p>
                            <h2>Palace of Chance Mobile App</h2>
                            <p>Although there is no actual Palace of Chance mobile app, US players are still able to access the site on their mobile devices. Players are able to do so by searching for the site in their mobile web browser.</p>

                            wagering requirement for bonuses and the uncertainty around payout speed is a large drawback. It is for this reason we have decided to rate Palace of Chance casino three out five.</p>
