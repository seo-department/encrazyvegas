                        <p><strong><img src="https://cdn.cosmicjs.com/41db2d10-2c0e-11ec-a256-9f386f540f3a-146x70-cherry-gold-casino.png" style="width: 146px;" class="right-image" alt="Cherry Gold Casino Reviews">Cherry Gold Casino</strong> first opened its doors in 2011.
                            You don&rsquo;t get to survive a decade without doing something right. Cherry Gold has clearly developed a good reputation with players, but that is not enough for us to base a review on. We asked our team of experts to spend some time with Cherry Gold
                            and put it through our strict review process. Let&rsquo;s see what they found and whether or not <em>Cherry Gold</em> is a recommended casino or not.&nbsp;</p>
                            <h2>Casinos Like Cherry Gold</h2>

                            <h2>Cherry Gold Welcome Bonuses and Promotions</h2>
                            <p>Welcome bonuses and promotional offers are some of the most exciting aspects of choosing a new casino site. Cherry Gold gets things off on the right foot with a 270% Welcome Bonus for new players, up to $2700. A player just needs to deposit $25 to claim
                            the bonus, with a maximum deposit amount of $1000. The bonus comes with a very fair 30x wagering requirement, which is much better than many competitor sites.</p>
                            <p>It doesn&rsquo;t end there, though; existing players also have several bonuses in store for them. These include Special Offer bonuses, as well as unique monthly promotional offers, and a referral bonus.</p>
                            <h2>Cherry Gold Banking Options</h2>
                            <p>Banking options aren&rsquo;t fun or exciting, but they&rsquo;re an important consideration to look at before choosing a casino. Players need to make sure there are good methods to deposit funds into their account, as well as being able to quickly and
                            easily withdraw winnings when they get lucky.</p>
                            <p>For deposit options, players can use Visa, Mastercard, and Bitcoin. The minimum deposit amount is $25, with the maximum deposit amount being $1000. However, if you deposit with Bitcoin, there is no limit to how much you can deposit. For payouts, players
                            can use Visa, MasterCard, and Wire Transfers. The minimum withdrawal amount is $100, with players able to withdraw up to $2000 once per week. Typically, payouts will take between 3 and 7 business days.</p>
                            <h2>Customer Support at Cherry Gold</h2>
                            <p>Another important consideration before signing up at a casino is customer support. Because online casinos are open 24/7, player support needs to be as well. The good news is that Cherry Gold does well in this area. Support is staffed all day, every day.
                            Should you run into any technical issues or need any form of assistance, the support team can be reached via live chat, email, or over the telephone.</p>
                            <h2>Cherry Gold Casino Game Selection</h2>

                            perfectly on pretty much all mobile devices. There&rsquo;s no need to download any apps, simply go to the casino&rsquo;s site from your mobile browser and log in with your details. All the games have been reworked and optimized to work on smaller, touch

                            <p>The single most important aspect for us to consider before deciding if we can recommend a casino is whether it is safe and secure for our readers. The good news is that Cherry Gold is fully licenced and regulated by a third-party organization. They ensure
                            that players are treated fairly, and games aren&rsquo;t rigged.</p>
