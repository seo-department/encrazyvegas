                            <h2>Mobile Compatibility</h2>
                            <p>Cherry Jackpot Runs a fully responsive mobile version of the casino. You can access the casino site directly from your mobile&rsquo;s web browser. You can use any mobile device, so whether it has an Android, iOS or Windows operating system, you can access
                            Cherry Jackpot online casino. However, the casino does not offer their download version via mobile; you can only choose instant play.</p>
                            <h2>Final Verdict</h2>
                            <p>Overall, Cherry Jackpot has made a massive appearance with their $20,000 welcome bonus. However, as with any bonus, read the terms and conditions to understand the wagering requirements and any other requirements it may come with. There are also great
                            bonuses for existing players and a decent games lobby. We definitely think it is a site worth trying and give it 4 out of five stars.</p>
