                            <h2>American Roulette Strategy to Win</h2>
                            <p>There are a number of strategies and systems you can use while playing American roulette. However, these strategies are structured ways of either increasing or decreasing your bets based on the previous rounds results. The most popular system is the Martingale
                            system.
                            </p>
                            <p>How this strategy works is that each time you lose, you will double you bet amount for the next round. When you win, you will keep the same bet. For example, if you placed a bet of $15 and lose, your next bet will be $30. If you lose again your bet will
                            be $60. If you win, you will keep your bet at $60.</p>
                            <p>While this may seem like a great strategy, it is important to stay focused. You can easily lose track of how much you are betting. Also, some of you are not able to afford the double up strategy, which is even more reason for you to keep track and not
                            chance loses. Instead, just have fun and play within your means.</p>
