                        <p><img src="https://imgix.cosmicjs.com/631110d0-2510-11ec-a33b-09138673c894-150x150-french-roulette-wheel.jpg" alt="French Roulette" title="French Roulette Wheel " width="150" height="150" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-fir"><strong>French roulette</strong> is
                            the ultimate, vintage-styled roulette game. It pays homage to the sophisticated, decadent era of Europe and epitomizes that fashionable French style. It&rsquo;s merely a revolutionary roulette game and is easy to play at any French roulette online casino.</p>
                            <p>Each bet type has its own <strong>French roulette</strong> payout. The French roulette simulator has numbers 0 to 36, and it has a French roulette table with various betting options and chips sizes. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at French roulette vs.
                            European, and see why you should play French roulette.</p>
                            <h2>French Roulette vs. European</h2>
                            <p>European and French roulette is somewhat similar to games, but one offers a bigger advantage than the other. Both games feature a house edge of 2.703%, but this does not mean you have the same chance of winning with both games.</p>
                            <p>In French roulette, the words and numbers are written in French, while on the European roulette table, everything is in English. However, many casino providers who offer French roulette have translated the table into English and provide the French term
                            below it.</p>
                            <p><img src="https://imgix.cosmicjs.com/6311ad10-2510-11ec-a33b-09138673c894-512x146-french-roulette-table.jpg" width="512" height="146" alt="French Roulette Table" title="French Roulette Table" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3464 fr-fic fr-dii"></p>
                            <p>French roulette has an advantage over European roulette with the La Partage rule. This rule will give everyone who uses the even money bet a fair chance. This means that if you place an even-money bet at the French roulette table and the ball lands in
                            the zero pocket, you will get half of your bet back. This rule also decreases the house edge to 1.35%.</p>

                            <h2>French Roulette vs. American</h2>
                            <p>French roulette is different from other roulette variants because of the unique table features. French roulette also has a lower house edge compared to other variants such as American roulette. The additional gameplay rule is the reason for the reduced
                            house edge.</p>
                            <p>French roulette is played with a standard European roulette wheel with 37 compartments. These are numbered from 1 to 36, alternating in colors red and black and 0 (zero), which appears in green.</p>
                            <p>In comparison, the American roulette wheel has 38 pockets. Numbers 1 to 36, alternating in colors red and black and two green pockets &ndash; 0 and 00. The American roulette wheel has a double zero.</p>
                            <p>Another differentiation between the two is the positioning of the roulette wheels. They are both located differently.</p>
                            <p>Another distinct difference you will notice is the position of the outside betting fields. On the American roulette table, the outside bets are found on the left side. While on the French roulette table, the outside bets are split and located on either
                            side of the table layout. These bets may sometimes be translated to English, which you will be able to see the French name below it.</p>
                            <h2>French Roulette Rules</h2>
                            <p>French roulette follows the same roulette wheel and rules as the European game. But, there are a few additional rules when the zero comes in to play. When the ball lands in the zero pocket, not all even money bets are lost. Instead, one of two rules apply:</p>
                            <ol>
                            <li><strong>En Prison Rule</strong>: When you translate &ldquo;En Prison,&rdquo; it means in prison. With this rule, when the ball lands on zero, your bet is not lost. Instead, it will stay remain there for the next round. However, if the ball lands on the
                            zero pocket for consecutive spins, the bet is lost.</li>
                            <li><strong>La Partage Rule</strong>: When you translate &ldquo;La Partage,&rdquo; it means splitting. With this rule, when the ball lands on the zero number, you will lose only half of your bet.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <h2>Why Play French Roulette?</h2>
                            <p>French roulette is simply elegant, fun, and wildly exciting. Many suggest French roulette is a better choice over European roulette, American roulette, and all other variants. It has distinct features that no other roulette variant offers. With the stakes
                            and winnings increased, you cannot go wrong with trying your luck on French roulette. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
