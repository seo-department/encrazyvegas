                            <p>Multi wheel roulette allows you to spin up to eight roulette wheels simultaneously. All of the wheels use the European roulette with a one zero pocket. Below is a quick step by step guide on how to play multi-player roulette.</p>

                            <li>The first step is to place your bets. You will have to place bets at every table you would like to bet on. You can also place as many types of bet as you like.</li>
                            <li>Once you have placed your bets, you will press the spin buttons.</li>
                            <li>All of the roulette wheel you placed bets on will spin simultaneously.</li>

                            <h2>Strategy and Rules</h2>
                            <p>As mentioned, multi-wheel roulette is based on European roulette. This means the house edge is approximately 2.7%, and there is not much you can do to change it. The most basic rules and strategy are to take advantage of the multi-wheel roulette. Bet
                            on as many, if not all, of the roulette wheels. Each roulette wheel stands on its own, and the results are independent of each other. So, if you lose on one wheel, you can win on another.</p>
                            <p>Another strategy is that while single number bets may lead to losses, if you have lucky numbers, you try to bet on them. It may turn your fortunes around and bring you some luck. You can also try sticking to outside bets. Effectively these may reward
                            smaller payouts, but they are more likely to pay out more often. While on the other hand, inside bets are less likely to payout, but it will be worth it when they do.</p>
                            <h2>Why Play Multi-Wheel Roulette</h2>
