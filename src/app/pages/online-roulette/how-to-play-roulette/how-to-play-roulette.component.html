                            <p>Roulette is a casino game that is rich in history and one that was developed by chance, more than anything else. Roulette is known as the game that&rsquo;s all about the odds, house edge and statistics. A French physicist and mathematician invented the
                            game while trying to invent the perpetual motion machine. Instead, the experiment turned into one of the most thrilling casino games of all times! The Frenchmen&rsquo;s design remained unchanged for many centuries. In 1842, the roulette wheel underwent
                            its first changes when Francois and Lois Blanc developed a roulette wheel with a single zero, specifically for the King of Monaco, King Charles the third. This was a huge deal, as it increased the house edge slightly. As time went on and the game made
                            its way around the world, it was only a matter of time before roulette would be influenced by the Americans. The Americans modified the wheel to have a double zero feature. This means the roulette wheel would now contain 38 numbers, giving an even greater
                            house edge.</p>
