                            a simple technique used to gain an advantage. The technique is used as a casino card game strategy to determine whether the next hand is likely to give a probable advantage to the player or dealer. When Players think the odds are in their favorite they
                            will increase their bets.</p>
                            <p>The basics of counting cards can be broken down into 4 easy steps, which we reveal below. In this <em>blackjack card counting</em> trainer, we walk you through the various card counting systems, techniques, and strategies.</p>
                            <h2>Hi-Lo Card Counting in Four Steps</h2>
                            <h3>Step 1. Assign every card a value</h3>
                            <p>You need to assign a card value to each card. The most common card counting system involved allocating the following values to cards:</p>
                            <p><img src="https://imgix.cosmicjs.com/72cd3fb0-25a8-11ec-a33b-09138673c894-649x154-hi-lo-card-couting-values.png" alt="Hi Lo Card Counting Strategies " title="Hi Lo Card Counting Strategies " class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3937 fr-fic fr-dii"></p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>2-6 = +1</li>
                            <li>7-9 = 0</li>
                            <li>10-Ace= -1</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If the card dealt is between the value of 2 and 6, you will add 1. If it is between 7 and 9, you will not do anything, and if it is a 10 or Ace, you will subtract 1.</p>
                            <h3>Step 2. Keep a running count based on the values of the card dealt</h3>
                            <p>Maintain a running count as cards are dealt by applying the above counting system. This will be done for every card that comes out of the shoe. You keep a running card count until the cards are reshuffled.</p>
                            <p>If you can keep an accurate running count, you will be able to use this information to determine your bet amount. When the running amount starts to increase, the advantage will shift to you, which is a good time to increase your bet amounts. However,
                            when the running count moves in the negative, the advantage sits with the casino, so you should decrease your bets. &nbsp;</p>
                            <h3>Step 3. Use this information to calculate the count per deck or &lsquo;true count.&rsquo;</h3>
                            <p>Many casinos started to use multiple decks of cards in blackjack as an attempt to through-off card counters. So, to a running count in a multi-deck blackjack game, the information needs to be translated into a true count or count per deck.</p>
                            <p>There is a difference to have a +5 running count with 1 deck remaining versus a running count +5 with 6 decks remaining. With the instance where 6 decks are remaining, there is less than 1 additional high card per pack, which means you have the advantage.
                            What matters here is the comparison of concentration between high and low cards.</p>
                            <p>However, with a +5 running count and only 1 deck of cards remaining, it is easy to know there are only 5 extra 10s and Aces remaining; this gives you the advantage. It is also why the true count is so important because you know exactly what is left. You
                            can use the below formulae to calculate the true count.</p>
                            <p><img src="https://imgix.cosmicjs.com/72fc6600-25a8-11ec-a33b-09138673c894-479x109-true-count-formula.png" alt="True Count Formula" title="True Count Formula" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3936 fr-fic fr-dii"></p>
                            <h3>Step 4. Adjust your bets as the true count rises</h3>
                            <p>Keeping an accurate running count and true count is valuable for knowing when the house edge shifts in your favor. It is to your advantage to use this information to improve your chances of making money. When the true count rises, you should raise your
                            bets. Understanding your bets is a good card counting strategy to minimize losses and capitalize on winning opportunities.</p>
                            <h2>Advanced Card Counting Techniques</h2>
                            <p>After mastering the above hi-lo card counting, we have a few advanced card counting systems to improve your skills.</p>
                            <h3>Omega II</h3>
                            <p>This card counting system is about being balanced. Developed by Bryce Carlson, you start off with zero (0) as your base in this technique. A positive card count means more low cards in the pack, and a negative count means there are more high-value cards
                            left in the deck. Cards will be counted as follows:</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>2, 3, or 7 are valued as 1</li>
                            <li>4, 5, and 6 are valued as 2</li>
                            <li>9 is valued as -1</li>
                            <li>10 and all face cards are -2</li>
                            <li>8 and Ace cards are 0</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><img src="https://imgix.cosmicjs.com/72fd5060-25a8-11ec-a33b-09138673c894-512x181-blackjack-card-counting-systems.png" alt="Blackjack Card Counting Systems " title="Blackjack Card Counting Systems " class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3938 fr-fic fr-dii"></p>
                            <h3>Wong Halves</h3>
                            <p>Developed by Stanford Wong, this is also a balance system card counting technique. Once the deck Is completely dealt with, your count should be zero. This system is considered as advanced as it uses fractions for keeping a running count.</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>3, 4, and 6 are valued as 1</li>
                            <li>2 and 7 are valued at 0.5</li>
                            <li>5 is valued as 1.5</li>
                            <li>8 is valued as 0</li>
                            <li>9 is valued as -0.5</li>
                            <li>10, Ace and face cards are -1</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Group Counting</h3>
                            <p>In some instances, card counters join forces. This means that multiple decks of cards at different tables can be counted simultaneously. Signals are used by counters to communicate to others when to join the hand and bet big.</p>
                            <h3>Counting Multiple Decks</h3>
                            <p>One way casinos try to make card counting almost impossible is by using multiple decks of cards. This makes it much harder to keep a running total. However, a straightforward card counting strategy uses the Hi-Lo strategy and then divides your running
                            count by the number of decks remaining. This will give you your true count and the advantage you have.</p>
