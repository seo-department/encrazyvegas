                            <h2>Casinos with the Best Blackjack Tips</h2>
                             <app-main-table></app-main-table>
                            <p>When players have a hard 11 hand vs. the dealer&rsquo;s up-card, it is a good idea to double down. This blackjack tip will increase a player&rsquo;s chance to win more money. However, in multi-deck blackjack games, the dealer may be required to stand
                            on a soft 17 hand. In this case, it is a better choice to hit against the dealer&rsquo;s ace.</p>
                            <h2>2. Splitting Pairs</h2>
                            <p>Regardless of the variants, you are playing or the up-card of the dealer, if you have a pair of 8&rsquo;s or Aces, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with splitting. Splitting 8&rsquo;s and Aces gives the upper hands as they are now playing two hands. When splitting
                            the 8s, each hand will start with an 8. This is better than starting the hand of 16 and hitting. Players are less likely to lose more money. Depending on the dealer&rsquo;s upper card, players will either cut their losses or win more. When it comes to
                            splitting Aces, it puts players in a massive advantage to get a hand of 21, if dealt a 10-value card after splitting. A dealer will not be able to beat a hand total of 21 from two cards unless they have a natural blackjack.</p>
                            <h2>3. When Not to Split</h2>
                            <p>Never to split a pair of 5&rsquo;s or 10&rsquo;s. It is much better to draw one or two additional cards with a pair of 5&rsquo;s than splitting and playing two separate hands. When it comes to a pair of 10&rsquo;s, players have a better chance of winning
                            with a hand of 20 and standing, than splitting into two hands. &nbsp;</p>
                            <h2>4. Insurance Bet</h2>
                            <p>An insurance bet is a bet against the dealer having blackjack. This bet is not the best option unless players know how to count cards. With insurance bets, the house has approximately a 6% advantage over players. This bet is more likely to lose player&rsquo;s
                            money. As if players have a natural blackjack, chances are players will only win their original bet back. If both the dealer and player have blackjack, it is a tie result, no win or loses.</p>
                            <h2>5. Soft Hands</h2>
                            <p>For players who have a sot hand, the following tricks will help improve your chances of winning.</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>Soft 17 &ndash; Always hit. This hand contains an Ace and 6, choosing to hit for another card gives you a better chance of getting a hand closer to 21.</li>
                            <li>Soft hand lower than 17 &ndash; Always hit. You have a better chance of improving your hand value and getting a higher hand than the dealer.</li>
                            <li>Soft 18 &ndash; Hit or double down. If the dealer&rsquo;s hand has an 8. 9, or 10 players are better off doubling down. Otherwise, they should hit.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>6. Hard hands</h2>
                            <p>For hard hands over 12, players can use the following blackjack tips and tricks.</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>Hand between 12 and 16. If the dealer has a hand value of 2 to 6, the best choice is to stand. The chances of a dealer getting higher hand when they are starting with such low hand are unlikely, but not impossible.</li>
                            <li>Hand between 12 and 16. If the dealer has a hand of 7 or higher, players have a better chance of winning by choosing to hit. This will improve your chances of a higher hand as dealers are in a good position to gain a higher hand if players stand.</li>
                            <li>Hard 17. Players with a hard 17 hand are better off standing.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>7. Don&rsquo;t Believe Myths</h2>
                            <p>There are many myths surrounding games, such as blackjack. Myth is that many players believe they are due a win. Players must never believe such myths or attempt to increase their bets because they think they are due a win. With online blackjack, casinos
                            use technology such as random number generators to determine the outcome of games. Games are also audited for fairness, and accuracy, meaning the casino cannot determine when to payout. It is all down to the strategy and skills of the player.</p>
                            <h2>8. Start Off Small</h2>
                            <p>It is always good to set a budget for yourself and start with small bets. Even if you are familiar with the game, start with small bets and find your rhythm for a few rounds. Then slowly start increasing your bets but still stay in control and alert.</p>
                            <h2>9. Progressive Betting</h2>
                            <p>When it comes to the idea of maximizing winnings, this is another myth players should not fall for. In the ideal world, there is no real way to maximize any winnings progressively. Placing higher wagers does not change the probabilities of the game. Nor
                            does it give players betters odds of winning. Top blackjack tips for winning is to have a good strategy and level of skill. Progressive betting will only make players lose more money quickly.</p>
                            <h2>10. Game Face</h2>
                            <p>Just like in any card game, your game face can make or break your game. Showing emotions may cause distractions and force players to place higher bets unnecessarily. If you are playing, multi-player blackjack, other players may bluff with their facial
                            expressions and cause others to lose more money. It is better to keep your game face on and do not let others tempt you to place wagers you cannot afford.</p>
