                            <h2>Blackjack Rules to Win</h2>
                            <p>Blackjack uses one or more standard 52-card deck of cards. The cards two through 10 are worth their face value. Kings, queens and jacks are each worth 10, and aces may be used as either one or 11. The object for the player is to draw cards totaling 21,
                            without going over. They can also win by having a hand total higher than the dealer&rsquo;s cards.</p>
                            <h3>Natural Blackjack Payout</h3>
                            <p>The best blackjack hand is one totaling 21 from the first two card. This is also known as a natural blackjack and pays 3-2. All other winning hands payout even-money. However, if the dealer also has a natural 21 or the hand is a tie, players receive their
                            original bet back. But, if the dealer has 21 with three or more cards, a player&rsquo;s blackjack hand win. The payoff for the player is 3-2.</p>
                            <h2>How to Deal Blackjack</h2>
                            <p>The blackjack table is in the form of an arc-shape. Up to 7 players can sit on the outside. Each table will come with a minimum and maximum bet amount. Players will also be able to find the game rules for their blackjack game. For example, the sign might
                            say, &ldquo;BLACKJACK. $5 to $2,000. Split any pair three times. Double on any two cards.&rdquo; That means the minimum bet at this table is $5 and the maximum is $2,000. Pairs may be split according to the rules of the variant. Also, if more matching
                            cards are dealt, the pair may be split up to three times for a total of four hands. The player may double the original bet (double down) and receive one more card on any two-card total.</p>
                            <h3>Number of Card Decks</h3>
                            <p>Most games use four, six, or eight decks. After being shuffled, the cards are placed in a receptacle called a shoe. From there the dealer can slide out one card at a time. Single- or double-deck games, most common in Nevada and Mississippi, may be dealt
                            from the dealer&rsquo;s hand.</p>
                            <h3>To Start a Blackjack Game</h3>
                            <p>Play begins when players place a bet in the betting square on the table. Each player and the dealer will then receive two cards. In a shoe game, players receive their cards face-up, and cannot touch their cards. In a single- or double-deck game bthe player
                            receive their cards face-down. The dealer receives one card face up for the player to see and one face-down.</p>
                            <p>Once the player and dealer have their cards, players decide how to play out their hands. The player will play their hand first. The dealer starts to play after the player stands:</p>
