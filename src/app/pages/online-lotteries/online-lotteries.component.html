                            lottery is a game of chance where players bet on several numbers being randomly picked. Lotteries are large-scale progressive jackpots that grow as players buy tickets. Players can select their own numbers, or have the software randomly select numbers
                            for them. The software runs independently so every player has a fair chance of winning millions of dollars. To win the entire jackpot, players need to match all their numbers to the selected lottery numbers. Lotteries have previously been used by governments
                            to raise funds for public works, wars, or large-scale construction projects. Lotteries are also used to fund state-owned parastatals, and homes for the impoverished.</p>
