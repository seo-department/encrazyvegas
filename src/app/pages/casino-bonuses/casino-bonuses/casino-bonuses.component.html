                            <p>It is best to read the terms and conditions of the casino you are playing at. Some casinos may allow this, while others won&rsquo;t. Most casinos are likely to impose restrictions on the amount you can win with a bonus, which means no progressive jackpots.</p>

                            <p>While it may seem, you have more money than you deposited because of the bonus offer. Casino bonuses actually sit in a different account to the money you deposited. To transfer the bonus money to cash funds, certain wagering requirements need to be met.</p>
                            <p>This way you can not claim a bonus and immediately withdraw it. So the play-through is the bonus amount plus your amount deposited. For example, if you deposited $100 and receive a 100% match bonus with 5x playthrough requirements, you will need to wager
                            $1000 in bets to be able to make a withdraw.</p>
