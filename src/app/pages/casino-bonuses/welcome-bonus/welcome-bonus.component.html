                            also known as a sign-up bonus, is a cash bonus offered to new players who join the casino.</p>
                            <p>Welcome casino bonuses are how casinos thank players for choosing their site. These bonuses are rewarded to players after they make a deposit. A <em>welcome bonus</em> can sometimes be offered as one big offer or small over the first few deposits at the
                            casino. Most often, these offers are in the form of a match deposit.</p>

                            <h2>What is a Welcome Bonus?</h2>
                            <p>A welcome bonus is only of the key differences between online and land-based casinos. Welcome bonuses are one of the main things that attract new players. It is one of the biggest bonus offers a player can receive from a casino. These serve to boost a
                            player&rsquo;s bankroll when they register and help score winnings from free money.</p>
                            <p>Casino welcome bonuses are unique to each casino. Bonuses which require players to make a deposit are referred to as deposit bonus. These bonuses are only offered when a deposit is made. There is also a no deposit bonus, which is offered to players for
                            just signing up to the casino.</p>
                            <h2>Why use a Welcome Bonus?</h2>
                            <p>Welcome bonuses are a great way to get introduced to a casino. It is also an excellent way to start building a bankroll. Without a welcome bonus, it can take some time and patience to build up a fairly good bankroll. With the right welcome bonus, players
                            can easily double or triple their first deposit amount.</p>

                            <h2>Types of Casino Welcome Bonuses</h2>
                            <p>There are a number of different types of casino bonuses on offer. The most common one offered is a match deposit.</p>
                            <h3>Cash Match Bonus</h3>
                            <p>This is the most popular casino bonus. Most casinos will advertise free money. For example, claim $1000 free. By using the term free, players think they are getting free money.</p>
                            <p>The catch, in most cases, is that players have to make a certain deposit to claim the $1000 bonus. With these bonuses, the more your deposit, the more you are likely to get back in return.</p>
                            <h3>Match Deposit Bonus</h3>
                            <p>Some casinos may put a max limit on the bonus amount you can claim. These types of bonuses are known as match deposit bonuses.</p>
                            <p>For example, 100% up to $1000. This means if you deposit $800, you will receive $800 in bonus funds. However, if you deposit $1200, you will receive $1000.</p>
                            <p>Before signing up to the first casino you come across, read the fine print of the bonus offer. There may be some terms and conditions you are not sure about or do not feel comfortable with. In this case, we suggest you do not sign up. There is a great
                            choice of casinos available at Crazy Vegas Casino.</p>
                            <p>You should also avoid using your credit card to claim match bonuses. It is more responsible to only deposit what you can afford to lose.</p>
                            <h3>No Deposit Casino Bonus</h3>
                            <p>This bonus rewards players with credits for just signing up. After registration and before players make a deposit, they will have free credits in their account. These usually have to be used within a specific time frame. Although these bonuses may sound
                            tempting, it is better to read the terms and conditions.</p>
                            <h3>Free Spins Bonus</h3>
                            <p>Another common bonus is free spins. A Free Spins bonus is usually given to players after making their first deposit. Free spins may be limited to a specific slot game. This is a great way for players to try a different slot or promote new slot games.</p>
