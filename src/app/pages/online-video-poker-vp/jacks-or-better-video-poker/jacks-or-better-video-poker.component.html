                            <p>Jacks or Better video poker, just like other poker and video poker games, relies on maths. The slightest mistakes may cost you a win. To help you understand to make better decisions when it comes to strategies.</p>
                            <h3>How to Play if you receive a low pair:</h3>
                            <p>A low pair in a jacks game or better is considered a pair of jacks or lower. &nbsp;These hands will not give you a payout unless you improve them.</p>
                            <p>In this situation, getting rid of the additional high card or breaking the pair when you have four cards to complete a straight. These moves can drastically reduce your odds. To help you, here are some situations where you will break the low pair.</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>When you have three cards to a royal flush, you will want to break the low pair to get the royal flush.</li>
                            <li>When you have four of the five cards needed for a flush.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>What to do when you receive a high pair?</h3>
                            <p>A high par in Jacks or Better is considered either a pair of Jacks, Queens, Kings, or Aces. With any of these high pairs, you are guaranteed a payout. There are not many reasons why you will break this hand. But there is one exception: &nbsp;</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>When you have four cards to the royal flush, it is worth breaking the high pair to see if you can get that one card needed to complete the royal flush. The payout difference for a royal flush is much greater than for a high pair, making the risk worth
                            it.
                            </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>How to play when you receive an already made poker hand?</h3>
                            <p>If you are fortunate enough to receive an already made hand from the first five cards dealt, you should always keep a full-house, flush and straight. But, in some cases, it might be worth breaking the straight or flush if it means you can get a royal
                            flush.
                            </p>

                            <ol>
                            <li>Throw out the fifth non-essential card if you have four out of five cards for a royal flush. This leaves an open spot to receive a possible completion to the royal flush.</li>
                            <li>Three of a kind, a flush, a high pair, and a straight wholly outrank three cards of a royal flush. Only play out three of a royal flush if you have lower ranking hands.</li>
                            <li>If you only have two cards to a royal flush, keep cards that could make up a higher hand. See the paytable for all winning hands.</li>
                            <li>If you only need one more card for a royal flush, don&rsquo;t hesitate to break up a flush, straight, or lower-ranking hand.</li>
                            <li>Hold on to a high pair (aces, kings, queens) over four of a flush or four straight.</li>
                            <li>Hold on to a high pair if you have four cards of a straight flush or four royal flush cards.</li>
                            <li>Never shred a full house.</li>
                            <li>If your hand has no possible ranking, low cards, or no or singular parts of a good hand, rather discard your cards</li>
                            <li>If you do not receive a good hand, it is wise to discard all the cards and receive 5 new ones.</li>
                            </ol>
