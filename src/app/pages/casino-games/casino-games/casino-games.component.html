                            <h2>Casino Games Online: House Edge</h2>
                            <p>A house edge is the advantage casinos have over you. It is the price of the player playing a casino game. However, when you look at the house edge in-depth there is more to it than the gaming hub simply having the benefit over you. There are many factors
                            that can have an impact on the house edge. The type of casino game, rules, and your level of skill can all have an impact on the chance of winning. It also affects the rate at which you win big or lose. In essence, the house edge represents the amount
                            of money the house keeps over a long period of time. It is easier to calculate the house edge for some games such as roulette and craps. Other casino games require a more practical mathematical analysis.</p>

                            <h3>House Edge in Games of Chance</h3>
                            <p>Some gambling games such as roulette, craps, baccarat, keno, and free casino slots are games of pure chance. No amount of skill or strategy will improve your odds. The house edge for these games are as follows:</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>Baccarat &ndash; 1.2%</li>
                            <li>Craps &ndash; Less than 1%</li>
                            <li>Roulette &ndash; 5.3% (roulette wheel with a double zero)</li>
                            <li>Slot Games &ndash; between 5% and 10%</li>
                            <li>Keno &ndash; 30%</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>House Edge in Games of Skill</h3>
                            <p>Games with the element of skill or strategy can impact the house edge. Such casino games include blackjack, video poker, poker variants like Caribbean Stud poker, Let It Ride, Three Card Poker, and Pai Gow poker. The house edge for these gambling games
                            are as follows:</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>Poker-based variants &ndash; between 3% and 5%</li>
                            <li>Video Poker &ndash; between 1% and 3% (depending on the level of skill)</li>
                            <li>Blackjack &ndash; 0.5% and 2% (depending on the level of skill, number of decks used and rules)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>Probability vs Casino Games with Best Odds</h2>
                            <p>Probability refers to the number of times an outcome occurs versus the number of times the experiment is conducted over the long run. Odds on the other hand look at the number of times an outcome does not occur compared to the number of times it does
                            occur. For example, in a card casino game, if a card is randomly selected from a standard deck of 52 cards, the probability is one in four. The odds for this are three to one. When looking at the true odds, this is represented by the payoff that will
                            make the bet on an event fair. For example, a bet on a single number in double-zero roulette has a probability of 1 in 38. This means to break even in the long run, you will need to win back the ratio of 37 to 1. However, the real ratio is 35 to 1.</p>
                            <h2>List of Casino Games</h2>
