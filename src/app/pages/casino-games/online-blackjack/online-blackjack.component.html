                            <p>Blackjack is a casino game where players are in the driver&rsquo;s seat. The decisions they make can impact the outcome of the game. Below are some of the decisions players may need to make and what they mean. Some options such as double down, split,
                            and insurance may only be available in some variants.</p>
                            <h3>Stand</h3>
                            <p>Players will choose this option when they are satisfied with their hand total. In <em>online blackjack</em>, players will select the stand button from the gameplay screen.</p>
                            <h3>Doubling Down</h3>
                            <p>This option allows players to increase their bet while playing out their hand. This bet amount cannot be higher than the original bet placed. Doubling down will also give players an additional card.</p>
                            <h3>Splitting Pairs</h3>
                            <p>If the first two cards dealt have the same value, players may have the option to split. When choosing to split the first two cards, the bet amount doubles. Players now have two hands to play and double the chance to win.</p>
                            <h3>Insurance Bet</h3>
                            <p>An optional bets when the dealer&rsquo;s face up card is the value of 10. It is a bet taken against the dealer having a natural blackjack. If the dealer does have a natural blackjack, you will get half of your bet back. However, if you also have a natural
                            blackjack, it will result in a tie.</p>
                            <h3>Surrender</h3>
                            <p>A bet allowing players to withdraw from the round, as long as their hand total is less than 21.</p>
