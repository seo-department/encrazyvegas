                            <h2>Online Craps Practice Table</h2>
                            <p>Craps is a casino game that uses a pair of dice to decide an outcome. The dice is thrown on the craps table and signifies whether certain bets win or lose and if the round ends. It doesn&rsquo;t take a craps expert to learn the different types of bets
                            you can make. In fact, any craps player can become an expert by simply learning the basics of the pass line bet.</p>
                            <h3>Pass line bet</h3>
                            <p>The pass line bet is an even-money bet. Simply put, players stand to win the exact amount they bet. The shooter is the person rolling the dice and must start every craps game with a come-out roll. A pass line bet wagers on the chance of the dice landing
                            on a 7 or 11. A 2, 3 or 12 will be a loss.</p>
                            <h3>Don&rsquo;t pass line bet</h3>
                            <p>This is the opposite of the pass line bet. That means that shooter needs to roll a 2, 3 or 12 for the even-money bet to win. Rolling a 7 or 11 will be a loss for this bet.</p>
                            <h3>The point round</h3>
                            <p>A point round is started if the dice lands on 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 on the come-out roll. To win this round, the craps player must roll the point they rolled previously before a 7 is rolled.</p>

                            <h2>Best Online Craps Bets</h2>
                            <p>Online gambling with craps is simple. However, if you are new to the game looking at the craps table for the first time may daunting. To help players get started, we have put together a craps trainer with the breakdown of rules.</p>
                            <h3>Craps</h3>
                            <p>The name of the popular dice casino game. It also happens to be the name of the numbers: 2, 3 and 12. The significance of this is that with the first dice roll, if any of these numbers are rolled, it is results in an instant loss.</p>
                            <h3>Pass Line&nbsp;&ndash; Bet</h3>
                            <p>This is a bet that the shooter will roll a 7 or 11 during the come out roll. It is also a bet on the point number being rolled before an 11 during the point phase.</p>
                            <h3>Don&rsquo;t Pass Line &ndash; Bet</h3>
                            <p>This works opposite to the Pass Line bet. Here players are betting that a 7 will be rolled before a 7 is rolled.</p>
                            <h3>Come &ndash; Bet</h3>
                            <p>You&rsquo;ll be able to place bets here after the come out roll, and you&rsquo;re essentially betting that the dice will pass.</p>
                            <h3>Don&rsquo;t Come &ndash; Bet</h3>
                            <p>This is just like the Come bet, except it&rsquo;s the opposite. Very simple.</p>
                            <h3>Field &ndash; Bet</h3>
                            <p>Field bets let you bet on which number you think will be rolled. You can bet on 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, or 12.</p>
                            <h3>Place Bets</h3>
                            <p>Look for the numbers 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. Go ahead and place your bet on these numbers. You&rsquo;ll land a payday if your number is rolled before a 7.</p>
                            <h3>6 or 8 &ndash; Bet</h3>
                            <p>This is very similar to a field bet of 6 or 8, with the exception that you&rsquo;re betting on a giant 6 or a giant 8. This is actually a sucker&rsquo;s bet, but we&rsquo;ll have more on that in our strategy section.</p>
                            <h3>Hardways &ndash; Bet</h3>
                            <p>Place one of these bets and you&rsquo;re predicting that the shooter will toss a 4, 6, 8, or 10 as a pair before that number comes up as a non-par. For example, if you bet on a hard 5, you&rsquo;re betting that pair of fives will hit before a 6 and 4.
                            Of course, if a 7 drops, you&rsquo;re done.</p>
                            <h3>Any Seven &ndash; Bet</h3>
                            <p>Think the next roll will be a 7? Drop your chips on Any Seven.</p>
                            <h3>Any Craps &ndash; Bet</h3>
                            <p>If you believe a 2, 3, or 12 will drop next, bet on Any Craps.</p>
                            <h2>Quick History of Online Craps</h2>
                            <p>Craps has several theories of where it originated from. A few theories include it being derived from a 12<sup>th</sup> Century, Old English game called Hazard and a French game called Crapaud. Crapaud is the French word meaning toad, which is a direct
                            reference to how street craps was played. Players would crouch and bend their legs like toads on the sidewalk while playing craps.</p>
                            <p>However, with the introduction of online craps, players don&rsquo;t need to crouch or stand to play this casino game. Craps online offers players comfort like never before, as they can play from their homes. This casino dice game has also grown in popularity
                            since it made the conversion online.</p>
