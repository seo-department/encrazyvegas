                            <h2>Arizona Gambling History</h2>
                            <p>1958 saw the first forms of gambling allowed in the form of horse and greyhound racing. The industry boomed in the state when it was the only form of gambling permitted. However, as other forms of gambling were permitted in the industry, horse and greyhound
                            betting declined.</p>
                            <p>In 1980, Arizona became the first state west of the Mississippi River to approve a state lottery. In 1988, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act got passed. This was one of the most unusual things to happen in the history of casinos in the United States. However,
                            at the time, gambling events were limited to bingo, off-track betting and lottery type drawings.</p>
                            <p>The 1990s saw the introduction of slot parlors. However, these were shut down in 1992. Later 12992, after a raid on five tribes that did not budget to shut down their slot parlor, gaming pacts started to get signed again.</p>
                            <p>Today, Arizona has a fair amount of casinos in the state. These casinos offer a combination of poker rooms, race betting, slots, table games and state lotteries.</p>
