                            <p><strong>Gambling in Pennsylvania</strong> has been legal since July 2010. The state offers casino gambling, lotteries, bingo, and horse racing. There are also other games of chance offered by non-profit organizations. Revenue from casinos is utilized
                            for economic and job creation. It is also used to make up the state deficit. The laws and regulations were implemented to curb illicit gambling in the state of Pennsylvania. In 2004, due to Act 71, Pennsylvania Racehorse Development and Gaming Act, the
                            Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board legalized casino gambling and racetracks, which contributed towards property tax relief funds.</p>

                            <h3>Bingo &amp; Games of Chance</h3>
                            <p>In 1988, a law was passed to permit organizations to conduct bingo games.</p>
                            <p>A few years later, the Pennsylvania Local Option Small Games of Chance Act of 1988 was passed. This permits gambling in non-profit organisations and for profit taverns. The games permitted under this act include pull-tab games, punchboards, raffles, daily,
                            weekly, and 50/50 drawings, Race Night Games, and pools.</p>
                            <h3>Further Gambling Laws</h3>
                            <p>In October 2017, the state legislature passed a bill allowing casino gambling at truck stops, airports, and online. The bill, signed by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf on October 30<sup>th</sup>, 2017 also permitted daily fantasy sports.</p>
                            <p>The bill also allowed for licenses of ten satellite casinos, as long as they were not located within 25 miles of an existing casino. Satellite casino licenses were only granted to existing casino owners in Pennsylvania. It would allow up 750 slot machines
                            and 30 table games. Municipalities also had the option to restrict casinos within their borders.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Following in the footsteps of Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware, it was the fourth state to legalize online gambling. It is also the only state to permit both gambling and lottery ticket sales online.</p>
