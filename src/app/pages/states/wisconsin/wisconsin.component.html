                            <p>Since the 1960&rsquo;s the state of Wisconsin has become more lenient in terms of gambling. In the 1990s, tribal casinos were legalized, and in the early 2020s, they were granted permission to expand. Below is a breakdown of how and when various forms
                            of gambling were legalized. Anyone over the age of 21 years can gamble at any of the casinos in Wisconsin.</p>

                            <li>In 1973,&nbsp;the state legalized charitable bingo.</li>

                            <li>In 1991, Wisconsin&nbsp;class III gaming compacts and the 11 Indian Tribes negotiated expansion opportunities. This led to the formation of the 22 casinos open in Wisconsin.</li>
                            <li>In 2003 they&nbsp;renegotiated to permit tribal casinos the right to expand. This meant they could&nbsp;operate 24-hours a day and add more games.</li>
