                            states in the United States where gambling is not allowed. This includes sports betting, bingo, or lotteries. The other state which does not allow gambling at all is Utah. Cruise ships traveling between the Hawaiian Islands are not allowed to offer gambling
                            activities.

                            <h2>Types of Gambling in Hawaii</h2>
                            <p>Hawaii does offer social poker games, but players are not legally allowed to turn a profit on games. Hawaii&rsquo;s online poker legislation allows pubs and public spaces to host poker tournaments, with stringent rules applying to game play: The hosts
                            are not allowed to charge buy-ins for poker games. The rules of not making a real money profit on poker games in Hawaii extend to not selling food or drinks to players during games.</p>
                            <h2>What is the Biggest Casino in the State of Hawaii?</h2>
                            <p>There are no land-based casinos in Hawaii. Due to stringent legislation outlawing all types of gambling in Hawaii, eager citizens do not have access to typical casino games like video slots, three-reel slots, blackjack, video poker, roulette, and other
                            table games. For people in Hawaii who wish to participate in gambling games are required to travel to another state where it is legal.</p>
                            <h2>Lottery Ticket Gambling in Hawaii</h2>
                            <p>There is no lottery, online or land-based, available in the state of Hawaii. Hawaii is not the only state which does not have a state lottery. Other states that do not offer official lottery sales:</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>Alabama</li>
                            <li>Utah</li>
                            <li>Alaska</li>
                            <li>Mississippi</li>
                            <li>Nevada</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Supporters of lottery ticket sales in the state of Hawaii argue that citizens should be able to buy tickets in Hawaii. Lottery revenue is often used to fund state-initiatives like scholarships. Each state has its own reasons for not allowing lottery sales,
                            including religious beliefs, oil-wealth, and disputes with existing gambling bodies. Hawaiians can purchase lottery tickets in other states, creating a loss of revenue for the state.</p>
                            <h2>Hawaiin Citizens Can Win the Lottery in Other States</h2>
                            <p>Although the lottery is not allowed in Hawaii, citizens can purchase tickets in other states. Hawaii taxes lottery winnings at about 11%. California and Delaware do not tax lottery winnings.</p>
