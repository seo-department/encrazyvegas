                            <h2>Commercial Casinos vs. Native American</h2>
                            <p>In America, players will find commercial casinos and Native American casinos. Commercial casinos are those players will find in the states such as Las Vegas. These casinos are owned by renowned companies such as the Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resort, Caesars
                            Entertainment, and MGM Resorts. There are 474 tribal casinos located across 28 states. In some states, players may find both commercial and tribal casinos, while in other states they may only have one or no casinos.</p>
                            <h3>Legal Native Casinos</h3>
                            <p>In 1987, native tribal casinos were permitted after a US Supreme Court decision. The case, California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, led to the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. This act gave Native American tribes the right to build tribal casinos.
                            In the court ruling, tribes were to sign treaties with the United States federal government to be considered as sovereign nations for the purposes of gambling.</p>
                            <p>The Native American tribe had to be recognized by the US Interior Department of Bureau of Indian Affairs prior to 1932, to be eligible to build a casino. If they were not recognized, then the Department would have to grant a waiver. In addition, tribes
                            were restricted from building the casinos on Native American reservations. Otherwise, subsequent rulings allowed tribes to buy private land for casino development. However, the purchased land had to be attached to the reservation lands.</p>
                            <h2>Tribal Casinos vs. Commercial Casinos</h2>
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Gaming compact to legally operate</strong>: The tribal authority for the Native American casino must agree to a gaming compact laid out by the state in which it is located. The tribe must also agree to pay taxes to the state for the regulating
                            of the casino. However, the state cannot charge more than the cost of regulatory oversight.</li>
                            <li><strong>Granting concessions</strong>: Higher taxes can be negotiated by states if the tribal casinos are given certain concessions. For example: it may include a monopoly inside a state on particular games, or agreements for new casinos.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gaming Machines <br></strong>Class III &ndash; Tribal casinos are not permitted to offer these games. These include casino games such as: slots and video poker, where the results are independently based on every spin.
                            <br>Class II &ndash; Tribal casinos are permitted to offer these gambling games. These jackpots follow the same format as lotteries and a raffle. In these games, a winning result on one spin can reduce the odds of winning big.</li>
                            <li><strong>Banked Table Games</strong>: These include games such as blackjack, baccarat, or roulette, where players take on the dealer. These games are also referred to as house-banked games as the casinos take on the role of the dealer. Such games are not
                            allowed to be offered in the state of California.</li>
                            <li><strong>California Craps</strong>: In California, regardless of whether it is a tribal or commercial casino, dice games such as craps cannot be resolved. Instead, these games are played with cards or with a combination of dice and cards.</li>
                            </ul>
