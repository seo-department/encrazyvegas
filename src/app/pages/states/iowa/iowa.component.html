                            during the 1800s, and it was also the first state to legalize riverboat casinos. In 1989, the state decided to regulate gambling, and in doing so, became the fourth state to legalize and regulate casino gambling. Today, Iowa has riverboat casinos, Native
                            American casinos, and pari-mutuel (racing) casinos throughout the state. This state also offers a state lottery (available as tickets sold over the counter), horse racing, and charity gambling, and dog racing. Off-track betting is considered legal online.
                            Fantasy sports sites are considered illegal in Iowa, and charity games offered through lodges, churches, and other organizations need to be registered with the state. The minimum gambling age is 21 years, and 18 years for bingo, and pari-mutuel casinos.</p>
