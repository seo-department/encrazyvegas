                            is a popular past-time, even though it is rigorously monitored. Kentucky has a long, renowned history with horse racing, but slot machines, poker, blackjack, roulette, craps, and other standard casino games are still considered taboo. Kentucky&rsquo;s
                            rich horse racing history began in 1985 with the first Kentucky Derby. The state of Kentucky does have a lottery that offers players another form of betting on a game of chance. Players can still legally gamble online, receive casino bonuses, deposit,
                            and win cash prizes. There are no &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; casinos in the state; thus, the most common gambling in Kentucky is pari-mutuel betting on horses across the ten racetracks around the state.</p>
