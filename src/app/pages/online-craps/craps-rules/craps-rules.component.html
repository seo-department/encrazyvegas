                            available to them. The most basic rule of craps is the pass line bet. When the shooter rolls the dice, they are only permitted to use one hand. We will simplify the <em>rules of craps</em> below to make it easy for everyone to understand.</p>
                            <h2>Craps Rules to Playing Online</h2>

                            <h2>Rules to Starting a Craps Round</h2>
                            <p>Craps become a lot easier when you play it online. This is because craps bets can seem a bit confusing at first. However, before you sit at any craps table, here are the basics you should know. Each game of craps has a shooter who rolls the dice. There
                            are two phases in a game of craps &ndash; the come-out roll and the point phase. Let&rsquo;s break down how each phase works.</p>
                            <h3>The Come-Out Roll Phase</h3>
                            <ul>
                            <li>This is the first phase of any craps game, after all bets have been placed.</li>
                            <li>During this phase, the shooter is aiming to roll a 7 or 11. If one of these is rolled, all pass line bets win.</li>
                            <li>However, if a 2, 3 or 12 is rolled, the pass line bet loses.</li>
                            <li>The best craps bets you can make are either the pass line bet or don&rsquo;t pass line bet. Either way, playing the pass line is your way to win at real cash craps.</li>
                            <li>If any other number is rolled, that number becomes the point, and a different round of craps is triggered.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>The Point Phase</h3>
                            <ul>
                            <li>During this phase of craps, the shooter needs to roll the point number they rolled to start the point phase.</li>
                            <li>The point needs to be rolled before a 7 is rolled for the pass line bet to win.</li>
                            <li>For a don&rsquo;t pass line bet to win, a 7 needs to be rolled before the point is rolled.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>Craps Betting Rules</h2>
                            <p>Craps offers players a lot more ways to win with all the bets you can place. However, some bets should be avoided as they have a high house edge. Here are our top tips to help you win at online craps.</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Avoid the Big 6 or 8:</strong> The craps table also contains bets that you should stay away from. The Big 6 or 8 is located on the corner of the craps table and promises massive payouts. This bet only pays out even money and to win you need to
                            throw a 6 or 8 before a 7 on the come-out roll.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use the Place bet:&nbsp;</strong>Wagering on a Place bet on 6 or 8 pays out 7:6, which is more than a Big 6 or 8 bet. Also, if a 7 is rolled on the come-out roll, you don&rsquo;t lose.</li>
                            <li><strong>Have a system:&nbsp;</strong>When playing real money craps, it&rsquo;s best to use the 3 Point Molly system. This is done by placing a pass line bet. After that, you should make a Come Line bet. Always make sure to back up single Come bets with
                            either single or double odds. Don&rsquo;t make more than two Come bets. When one of your Come bets win, make another Come bet. Repeat this method until the shooter throws their point or a 7. This system works by protecting your pass line bet with a Come
                            bet.</li>
                            </ul>
