                            <h2>Learn to How to Play Craps with Crazy Vegas Casino</h2>
                            <p>Online craps welcomes all types of players, it is not just for high rollers. Online craps casinos allow you to play at your own pace and budget. However, before placing any bets, understanding what the best craps bet is can be useful. The best craps bet
                            is the pass line. The pass line has a choice between either the pass line bet or the don&#39;t pass line bet.</p>
                            <h3>Pass line bet</h3>
                            <p>The pass line bet is the most basic of bets in the game of craps. This bet requires that players roll either a 7 or 11 to win on the come-out roll. However, the pass line bet loses if the dice roll is a 2 or 3. Any other number becomes the point. The
                            point must then be rolled before rolling a 7.</p>
                            <h3>Don&rsquo;t pass line bet</h3>
                            <p>The don&rsquo;t pass line bet is the exact opposite of the pass line bet. The only difference here is that players need to roll a 2, 3 or 12 to win. That means that rolling a 7 or 11 causes all bets on the don&rsquo;t pass line to lose. If a point is
                            established, a 7 must be rolled before rolling the point again.</p>
                            <h2>List of Bets in Craps</h2>
                            <p>Craps bets offer a wider variety of bets than almost any other casino game. Now that you know the basic bets of the craps game, here is a list of all the other bets you can make:</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Come Bets:&nbsp;</strong>A bet that you can only place after the point is established. Rolling a 7 or 11 after placing a come bet means you win. However, if the dice role is a 2, 3 or 12, you lose. Rolling any other number makes this your point
                            number for the come bet.</li>
                            <li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Come Bets:&nbsp;</strong>These bets lose if the dice role is a 7 or 11 but win if the dice role is a 2 or 3. Rolling anything else establishes the point. You can only win during a point if you roll a 7 before rolling the point.</li>
                            <li><strong>Place Bets:&nbsp;</strong>Place bets wager on a specific number from the range between 4 and 10. Rolling the number chosen before rolling a 7 results in a win. You can also use a place bet to wager on rolling a 7 before rolling a number between
                            4 and 10 which you choose.</li>
                            <li><strong>Buy Bets:&nbsp;</strong>Buy bets are the same as place bets, but with a higher payout and a 5% commission.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lay Bets:&nbsp;</strong>This is the opposite of the buy bet in that players need to roll a 7 before their number. This bet also comes with a 5% commission.</li>
                            <li><strong>Big 6 or 8:&nbsp;</strong>A bet that any 6 or 8 will appear before a 7.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hard-ways:&nbsp;</strong>These bets require players to roll a double before rolling a 7.</li>
                            <li><strong>Field Bets:&nbsp;</strong>With this bet if the dice role is a 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, or 12 you win. If the dice role is a 5,6, 7, or 8 you lose.</li>
                            <li><strong>Proposition Bets:&nbsp;</strong>There are several types of proposition bets. Players win this bet by choosing and rolling the following outcomes: Any 7, Any 11, Any Craps, Any Deuce, Aces, or Boxcar.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>Craps Strategy and Tips</h2>
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Stick to the pass line:&nbsp;</strong>These bets are the best for beginners and offer a decent house edge. The pass line is also not so difficult to learn and can win you some cash in real money craps.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use the 3-point molly system:&nbsp;</strong>This system protects your pass line bet by having three numbers working for you.</li>
                            <li><strong>Avoid proposition bets:&nbsp;</strong>These bets may be tempting with their large payout potential. However, the house edge gives you a slim chance of winning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Avoid the Big 6 or 8:&nbsp;</strong>The better alternative to this bet is to wager a place bet instead on 6 or 8. This has a house edge of 1.5% instead of 9% on the Big 6 or 8.</li>
                            </ul>
